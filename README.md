# AppNet: A new concept of Internet
######NB: AppWeb is the "beta name" of AppNet.

### What we hate
Difficulty in finding certain **small information quickly**.
* “Where can I find the bus timetable under my hotel?”
* “Where can I find the menu of the day of the school canteen?”
* “Could I enter this classroom or some professor is lecturing? Where is the
class schedule?”

“**Artificial**” instead of Natural Interactions:
* To find the right information/site, I have to search by myself.
* I might be forced to search an information in a maze of links in a site.
* I might need to write something with the uncomfortable smartphone
keyboard only to find a simple information 
  * Probably when I’m late!
* I might be forced to install a dedicated app for a single information.
  * What if I have the smartphone memory full?
  * What if I’m late? (again) I have to wait app download, installation, start-up, ...

* **User is forced to have an active interaction for something that
should be simple.**

### What we love
**Right information** in the **right place**:
* Right place often means right time.
* Information should be simple and accessible.
* Information could notify user when available.


**Natural interactions**:
* Minimize number of actions required to interact with something.


### How to love internet
**Apps instead of Web Sites**, because:
* Easy to use, *more naturals* than the classic Web Site approach.
  * Many **sites are becoming Web Apps**.
  * With touch devices, classic Web Site experience is really frustrating.
* **Touch devices** are becoming the **most important clients** in the web.
* Most of internet users, spends his time in smartphone Apps, not in sites.

**More, Few, Physical, Fast**:
* **More** dedicated apps.
* **Few** information in each app/site.
* **Physical** space as entry point (IoT), instead of URL.
* **Fast** and flexible access to apps (no install, no storage problems, like sites).


## AppNet idea
### The dream: a new standard for the internet.
* (Web) Apps instead of Web Sites.
  * Localized with GPS and/or Beacons (or other sensors)
  * Each app have a radius of action.
* Delivered on demand: right app in the right place.
  * User is notified when is in the radius of action of an app.
* Can receive the app and running instantly without installation.
  * Ideally: one app for each interactive object/space.
  * Light and Flexible
* No install, fast to download, cached in storage automatically to speed up most used.

### IoT for all:
* Objects become “smart” on the cheap:
  * Associate WebApp with a GPS location/Beacon that represents a place/object.
  * The logic will be delegated to a server on the internet and/or to the app.
  * GPS: for free, static (good for buildings).
  * Beacon: cheap, dynamic (beacon can move in the world, good for objects and indoor).
* A more complex object could also be involved:
  * Send WebApp with BT/NFC/Wifi (no need for internet connection. E.g.: TV, fridge, ...).
  * Behave as a server, updating in realtime the content of the WebApp with it’s own logic.
